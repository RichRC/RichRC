## Hi there 👋
I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst with a foundation in SQL, data manipulation, and visualization — focused on transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that drive smarter decisions.
I approach analytics with a human-centered lens: designing dashboards and reports that stakeholders actuallyunderstand and use, not just consume. My UX/UI background directly informs how I structure and present 
data, bridging the gap between technical analysis and intuitive communication.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
* Building end-to-end BI workfl ows that connect raw data to executive-ready dashboards.
* Exploring data storytelling techniques that make insights land for non-technical audiences.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* Advanced SQL optimization and window functions.
* dbt (data build tool) for scalable data transformation.
* Python for data analysis and automation.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
* BI and analytics projects where data quality and presentation both matter.
* Open-source tools that make data more accessible and actionable.
* Projects at the intersection of UX and data visualization.

- 💬 Ask me about:
* Turning messy, unstructured data into something clear and usable.
* Dashboard design principles that actually get used.
* How a background in hospitality, microbiology, and UX/UI shapes better data thinking.

- 📫 How to reach me: 
* Connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-rivera-cartagena/

- ⚡ Fun fact:
* I have thousands of vinyl records and a lifelong obsession with electronic music. I've also worked as a headsommelier — turns out recommending a $400 bottle of wine and choosing the right KPI for a stakeholder
require exactly the same skill: reading the room and trusting your data.

- 🛠️ Technical Skills
* BI & Analytics: SQL, Data Modeling, Dashboard Design, KPI Development, Data Visualization, Reporting
* Design & UX: Figma, Wireframing, Information Architecture, User Research, Prototyping, Adobe Creative Suite
* Tools & Platforms: Google Suite, Microsoft Office, Ableton Live
* Methods: User Journey Mapping, Competitive Analysis, Card Sorting, Persona Development, Stakeholder Alignment

- 🧠 A bit about my path
* My route to BI is unconventional — and that's the point. Years in hospitality as a head bartender, head sommelier, and DJ sharpened my pattern recognition,interpersonal intelligence, and ability to make data-driven calls under pressure.
Earlier academic work in biology and microbiology research instilled a rigorous, methodical approach to investigation that I carry into every analysis. I've always been drawn to research: asking the right questions, digging beneath the surface,
and letting evidence guide conclusions.
* The best BI work — like the best guest experience — starts with genuinely understanding the person on the other side of the data.
